1. Know what a constructor is, read through the form he gives for it in examples on the homework page.
2. Be careful when changing //*  and */ on the solutions and tests
3. Bon't confuse methods for object vs. methods for collections.  I tried to use the .add method on my book and person object. I think all the different methods are blurring in my mind.
4. For the first questions remember to put the class before the method ie. Math.sqrt() not sqrt   Date.today() not today() I wasted time trying to change other stuff when that was the little thing I forgot.
5. Read through the homework prior to Tuesday class.  Read through the homework before looking at the videos.  At least for me it helps pay better attention to them and know what questions to ask during the Tuesday zoom class.  
6. Don't accidently submit the test file instead of the solution file like I did.  Don't accidently erase one of the questions, like I did.  If you get really sleepy, stop.
7. I need to figure out how to use the hello.apex in order to debug on the fly.
